Please make sure that 'pythrpg.py' is in the SAME FOLDER as all .png files included in this .zip!
Counting this README there should be 14 items in the folder.

If this is ignored the python code will not run correctly!

Also make sure you have the random and tkinter python libraries properly installed and working on your system!
